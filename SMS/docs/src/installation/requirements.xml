      To use SMS on your
      Playstation, you will need to already have a working method to run
      arbitrary ELF files from your PS2 memory card.  Normal PS2s can't do
      this.  SMS is not an exploit to run ELF files, it needs an exploit or
      modchip to run.   You can't just burn the SMS.ELF file to CD as the PS2
      copy protection  system will stop you from running it.  Please also note
      that the CDXplorer CD-R method is not a method of starting SMS either.
      Rather it is a way of supplying media files to SMS once SMS is already
      running.
    </para>
