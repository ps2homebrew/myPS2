<para>Simple Media System (<application>SMS</application>) is a result the 
original author's (Eugene Plotnikov's) curiosity about Sony's Playstation2,
MIPS, DivX and MP3.
His original goal was to create a simple DivX player able to play good resolution
movies at good frame rate on an unmodded PS2 without any extra equipment such as HDD and network
adapter.

<para>
Why create a complete "system"? Just because having only a player program is not enough. Since
the PS2 conventionally ignores "illegal" disks, he took the idea of Drakonite with his UMCDR and developed
his own "UMCDR". (called CDDAFS). It just stores data on a CD audio disk format, which can be read on
(hopefully) any PS2.

This is the first component of SMS. The second component is a PC program that makes cue/bin files in order
to burn such a disk. And, finally, comes a player program itself. This system is not complete yet, but it can
play DivX movies with sound at good frame rate already. Player's base is a famous ffmpeg project. EEUG
took just some parts of it (DivX 5XX and MP3) and made some modifications specific to PS2 hardware. It
has been tested it with many DivX/XviD movies with different screen resolutions and encoding methods and
it seems to be working.

Since the initial concept, the SMS project has now grown to include support for network files, USB drives,
hard disc drives. It now also allows subtitles to be displayed, and contains a fully functional MP3 player.
All the software is now available in the subversion (SVN) repository at ps2dev.org. It has been made
available in the hope that it will be interesting for PS2 enthusiasts who use it as a base for their own
development.</para>

This document provides comprehensive installation and usage instructions.  
Currently it is written/maintained in DocBook XML format, and processed for
output in a variety of formats including single HTML and HTML pages grouped 
into sections.  Later it will (hopefully) be distributed in PDF format as 
well.
