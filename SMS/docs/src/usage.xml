    So, now that you've got SMS installed on your PS2
		(see <xref linkend="installation"/>), how do you get it play movies?  This
		chapter explains all you need to know.
	</para>

	<para lang="en">
	  To run SMS you first need to run your exploit or start up your PS2 with
		the modchip installed.  Then use the appropriate technique to start the
		SMS program. If you're using the
		<xref linkend="faq-independence"/>
		insert your (legitimate) PS1 trigger disc, and press reset. This will boot 
    your chosen launcher application, where you can select which actual ELF 
    you want to run.
  </para>

  <para lang="en">
    Next, if you're using LaunchELF as your boot application, you can run SMS
		by navigating to SMS.ELF and pressing O. You may want to assign a shortcut
		button to it so it is easier to load next time.
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para lang="en">
      If you use SMS regularly, you may want to assign it as the 'default'
      option in LauchELF, so that it starts automatically, after a short 
      delay.
    </para>
  </tip>

  <para lang="en">
    Once you've got SMS running, you should see the nice SMS graphical
		interface on your TV set. From this point onwards, all the instructions
		are the same, whichever Exploit/Modchip you are using.
